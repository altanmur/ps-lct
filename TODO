TODO:
=====
* French translations (salary rules in xml)
* Employer's contribution on payslip
* Figure out how to generate/print all payslips at once => cron job
* Seniority: it's 2% after 2 years, 1% for each subsequent year. But the percentages are calculated according to the wage at the time they "entered" that year.
* People automatically raise to the next echelon after 2 years, and their pay automatically follows.

DONE:
=====
* Calculate base wage based on category, class, echelon (see spreadsheet)
* Payslips & report: monthly/yearly (payslips: use filter, show all, select all, then print; report: choose start/end dates)
* Fix paybook report so it downloads the excell; I already know it works because I wrote it to /tmp and the report looks good.
* Round salary to lower 1000
* Fix Python code in salary rules to deal with OpenERP's insane convention of storing 0 as None in the DB

N/A:
====
* Create export fieldset for employees containing id, name, loan repayment, advance salary, other deductions, overtime (all in monetary terms, no hours for overtime since the formula is complex and not user-friendly to capture through the screens)  ==> Short manual action, no need to figure out how to export that into a data file.


Terms:
======
NTS == Net Taxable Salary
CNSS == something with Social Security (private & self-employed vs CRS for public sector)
TCS == Taxe Complementaire sur Salaires
IRPP == Impôt sur le Revenu des Personnes Physiques
